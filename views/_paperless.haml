  In summer 2012, I was a backend engineering intern at Paperless Post. Since then, I've been working there part time (as much as my school schedule allows).
  Paperless Post is a company that makes beautiful web based (and recently printed too!) cards and invitations. With 3D rending, animated envelopes, photo effects, and a ridiculous amount of customization, the experience it truely unrivaled.

  It's an awesome company with a lot of amazing people behind it. I work mostly on the Rails and Postgres backend, but also write JavaScript from time to time.
